Things I have learned:
1) JavaScript
   - Create elements directly from JS and put them on the DOM with createElement
   - Use arrays and loop through them with forEach
   - Consolidate my DOM manipulation skills with querySelector and addEventListener
   - Understand and manage closures variables scope

2) CSS
   - I brush up my flex abilities
   - Add transition to elements
